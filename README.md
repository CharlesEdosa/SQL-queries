## Project description

In attempting to strengthen the security of its system. It is my responsibility to make sure the system is secure, look into any possible security flaws, and update staff PCs as necessary. I have included examples of how to utilize SQL with filters for security-related tasks in the following steps.

### Retrieve after hours failed login attempts

A possible security incident happened after work hours, specifically after 18:00. Every unsuccessful attempt to log in after hours needs to be looked into.

I constructed a SQL query to filter for unsuccessful login attempts that happened after business hours, as you can see by looking at the code below.
